# Iris Flowers Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measurements.

## Data

The data set consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. The data set can be downloaded from [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/06/iris-flowers-classification-using-machine-learning/).

## Method

I use four machine learning models to perform the classification task:

- Decision Trees
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors

I compare the performance of each model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results

The results of the classification are shown in the table below:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Decision Trees | 0.96 | 0.96 | 0.96 | 0.96 |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | 0.93 | 0.93 | 0.93 | 0.93 |
| Support Vector Machines | 0.97 | 0.97 | 0.97 | 0.97 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 0.97 | 0.97 | 0.97 | 0.97 |

I can see that Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors have the highest accuracy and F1-score among the four models.

## Conclusion

I have successfully classified iris flowers using machine learning models. I have also evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics. We have found that Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors are the best models for this task.
